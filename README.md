# Alignment Grid
A simple World of Warcraft AddOn that overlays a grid on-screen to aid in aligning the user interface.

To install, copy the AlignmentGrid folder into `[World of Warcraft Install Location] > Interface > AddOns`.

Once installed, type `/align` while in-game to turn the grid on and off. You can add either `large`, `small` or `tiny` if you prefer a larger or smaller grid. For example, `/align small`.
